Dusk Colours is a basic colour changer based on the time of day with a very relaxing pattern.


Very basic JS for a simple necessity... changing colours of text based on time of day on a colour pattern resembling dusk time.
Easy to use, just import dusk.js on your project and use the function to execute it based on you refresh time.


dusk(/*DOM Element*/, /* miliseconds interval */);
